Connect to mongoDb using the mongo shell
For the CRUD operation of Insert and Retrival of documents we got some methods

1) Insert Operation

i) To insert a single document:
we have insertOne and the snippet goes as below

use 'database_name'
db.'collection_name'.insertOne({
  name: "aaa",
  age: 00,
  city: "bbb"
})

ii) To insert multiple documents:
we have insertMany and the example snippet as below

db.'collection_name'.insertMany([
  { name: "aaa", age: 01, city: "xyz" },
  { name: "bbb", age: 02, city: "yzx" },
  { name: "ccc", age: 03, city: "zxy" }
])

2) Find Operation
For find we can do three types of operation

i)Fetch all the documents:
find is used to fetch all the documents and below is the query to do it

db.'collection_name'.find()

ii) Fetch all the documents that matches the query condition
find is used here, and a argument i.e a query is passed to it

db.'collection_name'.find({age: {$gt: 20}}) this retrives the documents with age greater than 20

iii) To fetch only one document
findOne is used to fetch only one document that matches the query condition

db.'collection_name'.findOne({name: "aaa"})
