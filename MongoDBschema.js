//Database Schema Design and Setup:
//We designed the database schema to accommodate employee, department, and project data, ensuring flexibility and scalability.
//Below is a JSON representation of our MongoDB schema:

{
  "employee": {
    "_id": ObjectId,
    "name": String,
    "email": String,
    "department_id": ObjectId,
    "project_ids": [ObjectId]
  },
  "department": {
    "_id": ObjectId,
    "name": String,
    "location": String
  },
  "project": {
    "_id": ObjectId,
    "name": String,
    "description": String,
    "department_id": ObjectId

}
